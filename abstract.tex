In this thesis a basis for creating valuable rotordynamic models if formed. Theoretical models are formulated from the kinematic constraints to form a robust finite element model suited well for expansion. Analysis techniques for multiple degrees of freedom models with arbitrary damping are derived and demonstrated. These techniques include eigenvector and eigenvalue analysis of the complex state space equations. Furthermore, analysis techniques are developed for analyzing experimental data and comparing to theoretical models. All of the material is here to create a finite element model, compare its results to experimental results, and fine tune the design using stability analysis.
