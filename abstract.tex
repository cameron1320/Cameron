This thesis is intended to provide fundamental information for the construction, analysis of rotordynamic theoretical models and their comparison the experimental systems. Finite Element Method (FEM) is used to construct models using Timoshenko beam elements with viscous and hyteretic internal damping. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of complex state space equations are used to perform stability analysis, produce critical speed maps, and visualize mode shapes. Frequency domain analysis of experimental and theoretical data is used to provide Bode diagrams and full spectrum cascade plots. Synthesis of experimental and theoretical model analysis are used to optimize the control algorithm for an Active Magnetic Bearing on an Overhung rotor.
