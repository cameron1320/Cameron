This thesis is intended to provide fundamental information for the construction and analysis of rotordynamic theoretical models, and their comparison the experimental systems. Finite Element Method (FEM) is used to construct models using Timoshenko beam elements with viscous and hysteretic internal damping. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of state space equations are used to perform stability analysis, produce critical speed maps, and visualize mode shapes. Frequency domain analysis of theoretical models is used to provide Bode diagrams and in experimental data full spectrum cascade plots. Experimental and theoretical model analyses are used to optimize the control algorithm for an Active Magnetic Bearing on an overhung rotor.
